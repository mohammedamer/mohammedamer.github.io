I’m a Senior Researcher at Fujitsu Research of Europe, developing graph-based, multimodal AI that learns from heterogeneous data to deliver general-purpose models and decision support across domains. I work end-to-end—from problem discovery and data readiness to modeling, evaluation, and delivery—prioritizing clean interfaces, reproducible pipelines, and human-interpretable outputs.

My interests include representation learning on graphs, cross-modal alignment and fusion, reliability and uncertainty, and practical interpretability. I’m motivated by data-rich settings where trustworthy decisions matter—healthcare, quality and safety, public services, and beyond. I collaborate closely with domain experts, contribute to reusable tooling when possible, and mentor teams to translate research insights into simple, useful systems. My goal is to turn complex, multi-source data into reliable, actionable insight.
